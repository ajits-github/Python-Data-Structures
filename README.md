# Python Data Structures

Welcome to the **Python Data Structures** project! This repository is a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures implemented in Python. It serves as a learning resource for anyone interested in understanding how various data structures work and how to implement them in Python.

## Features

- **Arrays and Lists**: Basic operations and applications.
- **Stacks**: Implementation of stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
- **Queues**: Different types of queues, including circular and priority queues.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with various operations.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and heap implementations.
- **Graphs**: Representation of graphs, depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and shortest path algorithms.
- **Hash Tables**: Implementation of hash tables with collision resolution techniques.
- **Sets**: Set operations and applications.
- **Heaps**: Min-heap and max-heap implementation.
- **Trie**: Implementation of Trie data structure for efficient string manipulation.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Various sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajits-github/Python-Data-Structures.git
cd python-data-structures
```

## Usage

Each data structure is implemented in its own Python file with examples and explanations. You can run any file directly to see the data structure in action:

```bash
python stack.py
```

Feel free to explore the code and modify it to better understand how each data structure works.
